# The Pintos Operating System in Rust

The goal of this repository is to provide a full Rust port of the educational
operating system Pintos. The original OS was written in C which is not a good
choice anymore given the existence of Rust. The implementation is intented to
be closely aligned to the original project structure while also making use of
Rust principles and abstractions. This means that many parts will look different
than than the original while having roughly the same structure and the same
functionality.
